Github Stars Repositories Manager

</div>

## ðŸŽ¯ Background

As the first social platform for developers, Github has countless excellent open source projects, which brings great convenience to work and study. When you encounter a project you need or like, just click Star to get it.

Star is easy, but as the number of Starred Repositories grows, it is inevitable that you canâ€™t remember the name of a certain project when you need to use it, and Github only provides a simple search, so finding the target Starred Repository has become a little troublesome.

Therefore, having your own Github Stars Repositories Manager is also a must-have for developers. ðŸ’¡
